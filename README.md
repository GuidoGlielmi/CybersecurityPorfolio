# Cybersecurity Porfolio

## Started from Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program

**I'm a fullstack web developer passionated about security, pillar which I think is fundamental in any application, to make the internet a safe and trusted highway for users across the globe.**

My main interest about cybersecurity is engaging in threat detection and developing systems as secure as I possibly can, to encourage people to make a responsible use of the internet and to transform it to generate the most value. I think my skills and ideology can help build secure systems that people can trust.
