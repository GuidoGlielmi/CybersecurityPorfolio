# Cybersecurity Porfolio

## Started from Google's Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program

**I'm a fullstack web developer passionated about security, pillar which I think is fundamental in any application, to make the internet a safe and trusted highway for users across the globe.**

My strenghts are programming in different languages, frameworks and environments and strong written and verbal communication.

My most important values are protecting people, seek out injustices and ensuring equitable access.

My main interest about cybersecurity is engaging in threat detection and developing systems as secure as I possibly can, to encourage people to make a responsible use of the internet and to transform it to generate the most value. I think my skills and ideology can help build secure systems that people can trust.

My main goal is to learn about network protocol analyzers and programming.
